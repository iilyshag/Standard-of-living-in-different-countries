# Standard-of-living-in-different-countries

Comparison of prices and cost of living in cities of different countries and continents
Hypotheses:
1. Food prices in Europe are higher than on other continents, the average salary depends on the population
2. Restaurants and entertainment in the capitals are more expensive
3. It is easier to pay a mortgage in the region
4. The prices of cigarettes and alcohol depend on the continent
5. In Russia, the standard of living is lower than in other countries (financially)

To test our hypotheses, we decided to take the most developed countries. All the objects of our sample are cities of the Big Twenty countries. We have taken the countries that are of the greatest interest to us.

In our study, we are going to rely on the following categories:
1. Prices for visiting cafes and restaurants
2. Food prices
3. Transport
4. Utilities, per month
5. Sports and recreation
6. Salary and financing
7. Costs for children
8. Clothing and shoes
9. Prices for rental housing, per month
10. Prices for the purchase of an apartment
